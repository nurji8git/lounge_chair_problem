# Solution for lounge chair allocation
Pool has n lounge chairs arranged in a circle that are temporarily rented to bathers for a fee.
When a group of k guests arrives, you must find k free sunbeds next to each other.
When the group leaves after bathing, all k beds simultaneously become free and can be redistributed.
If there are not enough sunbeds nearby, the group leaves again, and the lifeguard makes no money.
The goal is to keep the sunbeds occupied as efficiently as possible so that the lifeguard earns a lot of money.
Write a Java program to help the lifeguard occupy the sun loungers in the best way possible.

The main algorithms are in the CircularDataStructure class
